# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline: Unexpected Results with $in Operator

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when using the `$in` operator incorrectly. The issue arises when the array passed to `$in` contains nested arrays instead of individual values.

## Bug Description
The code uses `$in` to filter documents where the `field` value matches any value in the specified array. However, if the array contains nested arrays, the `$in` operator will not correctly match the nested values. This leads to unexpected results, where documents that should be included in the results are excluded.

## Solution
To fix this error, ensure that the array passed to the `$in` operator contains only individual values and not nested arrays.  If you need to match against nested arrays, consider using the `$elemMatch` operator.
